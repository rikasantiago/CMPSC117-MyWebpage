	<br>WHENEVER WE (THE ADMINS) DECIDE TO MEET-UP WE ALWAYS WIND UP ASKING ONE CERTAIN QUESTION: </br>
	"YAN NA TI MAYAT PAGSABAWAN TUN BGAT?" IT HAS BEEN EMBEDDED AS A PART OF OUR GROUP'S TRADITION TO ASK THIS QUESTION.</br>
	MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THIS QUESTION WILL REMAIN UNANSWERED, AND SOMETIMES WILL CAUSE SMALL ARGUEMENTS WITHIN THE GROUP.</br>
	<br>
	CONVENIENTLY, ONE NIGHT, AS WERE BANTERING WITH EACH OTHER, </br>
	ONE OF THE ADMINS THOUGHT "WHAT IF WE MAKE A GROUP THAT HUNTS FOR SABAW?" </br>
	AND WE ALL AGREED, AT FIRST WE DECIDED TO NAME IT "IGOP HUNTER" </br>
	BUT THEN AGAIN, WE HUNT FOR SABAW. THUS THE NAME "SABAW HUNTERS" WAS COINED.</br>
	SABAW HUNTERS ILOCOS, DOES NOT ONLY STAND TO AIDE US IN LOOKING FOR PLACES TO IGOP, </br>
	BUT IT IS ALSO ONE MEDIUM FOR LOCAL EATERIES TO PROMOTE THEIR SABAW </br>
	AND OTHER PRODUCTS THAT REVOLVES AROUND SABAW.</br>
	THANKYOU FOR YOU SUPPORT KAIGOP! HAPPY HUNTING! ðŸ¤²ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥</br>
